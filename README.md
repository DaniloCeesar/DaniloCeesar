### Hi, I'm Danilo César 👋

<samp>👨‍⚖️ I'm a lawyer and master's student in Computer Science. My current fields of work are Artificial Intelligence, and Intellectual Property applied for software and emerging technologies.</samp>

<samp>👨‍💻 I'm always open for new opportunities to improve Law and Legaltech. Sometimes I write about things I find interesting: you can read my posts on [DEV Community](https://dev.to/danilo), on [Hashnode](https://danilocesar.hashnode.dev/) and on [Medium](https://danilocsar.medium.com/).</samp>

<samp>🤸‍♂️ Fun fact about me? I read a lot of software changelogs and, yeah, I do like to give feedback. [Let me know](https://danilo.discente.com/) if you want to talk about your next amazing software.</samp>
